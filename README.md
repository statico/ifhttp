**ifhttp** provides an HTTP REST interface for interacting with Z-Machine interactive fiction (IF) stories. Clients can connect to the service to start a game and then POST commands to it. Sessions are deleted after a while in a feeble attempt to save memory. This service is definitely DoS-able.

**See a live example on https://www.langworth.com/**

## Usage

    $ docker pull statico/ifhttp
    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/stories:/data statico/ifhttp npm run -s start -- /data/story.z8

All request and response bodies should be JSON. In addition to a status code, requests may return a JSON object with an `error` property which describes the error.

Response:

```json

### POST /send

Sends a command to the game.

```json
